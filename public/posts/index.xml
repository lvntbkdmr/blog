      <description>Gulliver&amp;#39;s TravelsIt would not be proper, for some reasons, to trouble the
reader with the particulars of our adventures in those seas; let it suffice to
inform him, that in our passage from thence to the East Indies, we were driven
by a violent storm to the north-west of Van Diemen&amp;#39;s Land. Twelve of our crew
were dead by immoderate labour and ill food; the rest were in a very weak
condition. On the 5th of November, which was the beginning of summer in those
parts, the weather being very hazy, t</description>

      <description>Now for the fun part: Ulysses can output your writing to a host of standard
formats, such as Plain and Rich Text, HTML, ePub, PDF and DOCX. It does so by
translating your plain text input based on the definition of the minimal markup.
If your brain starts to hurt, here’s a simple example…

Let’s assume you want to emphasize a text passage. You select the word
“emphasize” (do so), and mark it up as emphasis (tap the A| button and select
Emphasis). Notice the extra characters that were entered aro</description>

      <description>By default, your texts, along with all your groups and filters, will get stored
in iCloud. This is great, because you can seamlessly switch between iPad, iPhone
and Mac, since Ulysses works on all of them. Just visit the App Store or the Mac
App Store, install Ulysses on your devices, and you’re good to go: Outline a
short story on the subway, and work out the details at home on your Mac. So
cool.

As soon as you’re connected to the internet, sync will automatically start and

      <description>These days I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a DIY built-in bookcase on top of a cabinet for our home office which I share with my wife.
Of course when you start a DIY project you first need to get a bunch of tools to be able to build stuff. Therefore, I started researching the minimal setup required for this type of job. Watched several youtube videos, read some very detailed blog posts etc.</description>

      <description>A hackintosh journey of me in order to join the elegant &amp;ldquo;just working&amp;rdquo; environment of Apple by a more budget-friendly way.
The term &amp;ldquo;hackintosh&amp;rdquo; has been around since Apple has switched from PowerPC to Intel architecture around 2005. Ever since then, hackers try to integrate macOS/OS X software to be run on custom made platforms. There is a huge community behind this struggle such as tonymacx86, insanelymac and of course /r/hackintosh sub-reddit.</description>
