      <description>My Hackintosh Journey ! A hackintosh journey of me in order to join the elegant &amp;ldquo;just working&amp;rdquo; environment of Apple by a more budget-friendly way.
The term &amp;ldquo;hackintosh&amp;rdquo; has been around since Apple has switched from PowerPC to Intel architecture around 2005. Ever since then, hackers try to integrate macOS/OS X software to be run on custom made platforms. There is a huge community behind this struggle such as tonymacx86, insanelymac and of course /r/hackintosh sub-reddit.</description>
