[{"content":"Gulliver\u0026rsquo;s Travels\nIt would not be proper, for some reasons, to trouble the reader with the particulars of our adventures in those seas; let it suffice to inform him, that in our passage from thence to the East Indies, we were driven by a violent storm to the north-west of Van Diemen\u0026rsquo;s Land. Twelve of our crew were dead by immoderate labour and ill food; the rest were in a very weak condition. On the 5th of November, which was the beginning of summer in those parts, the weather being very hazy, the seamen spied a rock within half a cable\u0026rsquo;s length of the ship; but the wind was so strong, that we were driven directly upon it, and immediately split. Six of the crew, of whom I was one, having let down the boat into the sea, made a shift to get clear of the ship and the rock. We rowed, by my computation, about three leagues, till we were able to work no longer, being already spent with labour while we were in the ship. We therefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves, and in about half an hour the boat was overset by a sudden flurry from the north. What became of my companions in the boat, as well as of those who escaped on the rock, or were left in the vessel, I cannot tell; but conclude they were all lost. For my own part, I swam as fortune directed me, and was pushed forward by wind and tide. I often let my legs drop, and could feel no bottom; but when I was almost gone, and able to struggle no longer, I found myself within my depth; and by this time the storm was much abated. The declivity was so small, that I walked near a mile before I got to the shore, which I conjectured was about eight o\u0026rsquo;clock in the evening. I then advanced forward near half a mile, but could not discover any sign of houses or inhabitants; at least I was in so weak a condition, that I did not observe them. I was extremely tired, and with that, and the heat of the weather, and about half a pint of brandy that I drank as I left the ship, I found myself much inclined to sleep. I lay down on the grass, which was very short and soft, where I slept sounder than ever I remembered to have done in my life, and, as I reckoned, about nine hours; for when I awaked, it was just day-light.\nI attempted to rise, but was not able to stir: for, as I happened to lie on my back, I found my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to the ground; and my hair, which was long and thick, tied down in the same manner. I likewise felt several slender ligatures across my body, from my arm-pits to my thighs. I could only look upwards; the sun began to grow hot, and the light offended my eyes. I heard a confused noise about me; but in the posture I lay, could see nothing except the sky. In a little time I felt something alive moving on my left leg, which advancing gently forward over my breast, came almost up to my chin; when, bending my eyes downwards as much as I could, I perceived it to be a human creature not six inches high, with a bow and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his back. In the mean time, I felt at least forty more of the same kind (as I conjectured) following the first. I was in the utmost astonishment, and roared so loud, that they all ran back in a fright; and some of them, as I was afterwards told, were hurt with the falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground.\nHowever, they soon returned, and one of them, who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face, lifting up his hands and eyes by way of admiration, cried out in a shrill but distinct voice, Hekinah degul: the others repeated the same words several times, but then I knew not what they meant. I lay all this while, as the reader may believe, in great uneasiness. At length, struggling to get loose, I had the fortune to break the strings, and wrench out the pegs that fastened my left arm to the ground; for, by lifting it up to my face, I discovered the methods they had taken to bind me, and at the same time with a violent pull, which gave me excessive pain, I a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair on the left side, so that I was just able to turn my head about two inches.\nSource: Wikisource – Gulliver\u0026rsquo;s Travels\n","permalink":"https://leventbekdemir.com/posts/a-voyage-to-lilliput/","summary":"Gulliver\u0026rsquo;s TravelsIt would not be proper, for some reasons, to trouble the\nreader with the particulars of our adventures in those seas; let it suffice to\ninform him, that in our passage from thence to the East Indies, we were driven\nby a violent storm to the north-west of Van Diemen\u0026rsquo;s Land.

It does so by translating your plain text input based on the definition of the minimal markup. If your brain starts to hurt, here’s a simple example…\nLet’s assume you want to emphasize a text passage. You select the word “emphasize” (do so), and mark it up as emphasis (tap the A| button and select Emphasis). Notice the extra characters that were entered around the word.\nYou have just told Ulysses, in its own “plain text language”, that this passage should be an emphasized passage. Now Ulysses knows and will never forget. So, when you export your text to, say, a PDF, Ulysses will translate this emphasized passage into what a PDF will understand and display – in this case, it will format your emphasized passage as italicized text.\nGive it a try:\n Dismiss the keyboard (bottom right of keyboard) Open the editor menu (circled ellipsis) and select Export. In the view that just slid up, select PDF. The “emphasize” above should be set in italics.  Headlines Such as This Will Get a Larger Font If you export to HTML instead, Ulysses will translate the emphasized passage to semantically correct \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;, and the headline will be tagged with \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;.\nAnd so on.\nThe beauty of this should be obvious by now: Instead of worrying about how your output looks, you can concentrate on what your content is supposed to mean. This may be frightening at first, but trust us, it’s not.\nIt’s awesome.\nShare Your Work You can send a PDF via email or save it to iCloud. You can open a DOCX file in Microsoft Word or Pages. You can publish your text as blog post to WordPress, Ghost, Micro.blog or Medium.\nIn the exporter, tap the Share icon to list all available options.

Everything about your layout and design can be changed, so you\u0026rsquo;re not stuck with yet another clone of a social network profile.\nHow far you want to go with customization is completely up to you, there\u0026rsquo;s no right or wrong approach! The majority of people use one of Ghost\u0026rsquo;s built-in themes to get started, and then progress to something more bespoke later on as their site grows.\nThe best way to get started is with Ghost\u0026rsquo;s branding settings, where you can set up colors, images and logos to fit with your brand.\nGhost Admin → Settings → Branding\nAny Ghost theme that\u0026rsquo;s up to date and compatible with Ghost 4.0 and higher will reflect your branding settings in the preview window, so you can see what your site will look like as you experiment with different options.\nWhen selecting an accent color, try to choose something which will contrast well with white text. Many themes will use your accent color as the background for buttons, headers and navigational elements. Vibrant colors with a darker hue tend to work best, as a general rule.\nInstalling Ghost themes By default, new sites are created with Ghost\u0026rsquo;s friendly publication theme, called Casper. Everything in Casper is optimized to work for the most common types of blog, newsletter and publication that people create with Ghost — so it\u0026rsquo;s a perfect place to start.\nHowever, there are hundreds of different themes available to install, so you can pick out a look and feel that suits you best.\nGhost Admin → Settings → Theme\nInside Ghost\u0026rsquo;s theme settings you\u0026rsquo;ll find 4 more official themes that can be directly installed and activated. Each theme is suited to slightly different use-cases.\n Casper (default) — Made for all sorts of blogs and newsletters Edition — A beautiful minimal template for newsletter authors Alto — A slick news/magazine style design for creators London — A light photography theme with a bold grid Ease — A library theme for organizing large content archives  And if none of those feel quite right, head on over to the Ghost Marketplace, where you\u0026rsquo;ll find a huge variety of both free and premium themes.\nBuilding something custom Finally, if you want something completely bespoke for your site, you can always build a custom theme from scratch and upload it to your site.\nGhost\u0026rsquo;s theming template files are very easy to work with, and can be picked up in the space of a few hours by anyone who has just a little bit of knowledge of HTML and CSS. Templates from other platforms can also be ported to Ghost with relatively little effort.\nIf you want to take a quick look at the theme syntax to see what it\u0026rsquo;s like, you can browse through the files of the default Casper theme. We\u0026rsquo;ve added tons of inline code comments to make it easy to learn, and the structure is very readable.\n{{#post}} \u0026lt;article class=\u0026quot;article {{post_class}}\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{title}}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{#if feature_image}} \u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;{{feature_image}}\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;Feature image\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; {{/if}} {{content}} \u0026lt;/article\u0026gt; {{/post}}  A snippet from a post template\nSee?

Don\u0026rsquo;t let its minimal looks fool you, though, beneath the surface lies a powerful editing toolset designed to accommodate the extensive needs of modern creators.\nFor many, the base canvas of the Ghost editor will feel familiar. You can start writing as you would expect, highlight content to access the toolbar you would expect, and generally use all of the keyboard shortcuts you would expect.\nOur main focus in building the Ghost editor is to try and make as many things that you hope/expect might work: actually work.\n You can copy and paste raw content from web pages, and Ghost will do its best to correctly preserve the formatting. Pasting an image from your clipboard will upload inline. Pasting a social media URL will automatically create an embed. Highlight a word in the editor and paste a URL from your clipboard on top: Ghost will turn it into a link. You can also paste (or write!) Markdown and Ghost will usually be able to auto-convert it into fully editable, formatted content.  The Ghost editor. Also available in dark-mode, for late night writing sessions.\nThe goal, as much as possible, is for things to work so that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to think so much about the editor. You won\u0026rsquo;t find any disastrous \u0026ldquo;block builders\u0026rdquo; here, where you have to open 6 submenus and choose from 18 different but identical alignment options. That\u0026rsquo;s not what Ghost is about.\nWhat you will find though, is dynamic cards which allow you to embed rich media into your posts and create beautifully laid out stories.\nUsing cards You can insert dynamic cards inside post content using the + button, which appears on new lines, or by typing / on a new line to trigger the card menu. Many of the choices are simple and intuitive, like bookmark cards, which allow you to create rich links with embedded structured data:\n[\nOpen Subscription Platforms\nA shared movement for independent subscription data.\nOpen Subscription Platforms\n](https://opensubscriptionplatforms.com/)\nor embed cards which make it easy to insert content you want to share with your audience, from external services:\nBut, dig a little deeper, and you\u0026rsquo;ll also find more advanced cards, like one that only shows up in email newsletters (great for personalized introductions) and a comprehensive set of specialized cards for different types of images and galleries.\n Once you start mixing text and image cards creatively, the whole narrative of the story changes. Suddenly, you\u0026rsquo;re working in a new format.\n As it turns out, sometimes pictures and a thousand words go together really well. Telling people a great story often has much more impact if they can feel, even for a moment, as though they were right there with you.\nPeaceful places\nGalleries and image cards can be combined in so many different ways — the only limit is your imagination.\nBuild workflows with snippets One of the most powerful features of the Ghost editor is the ability to create and re-use content snippets. If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever used an email client with a concept of saved replies then this will be immediately intuitive.\nTo create a snippet, select a piece of content in the editor that you\u0026rsquo;d like to re-use in future, then click on the snippet icon in the toolbar. Give your snippet a name, and you\u0026rsquo;re all done. Now your snippet will be available from within the card menu, or you can search for it directly using the / command.\nThis works really well for saving images you might want to use often, like a company logo or team photo, links to resources you find yourself often linking to, or introductions and passages that you want to remember.\nYou can even build entire post templates or outlines to create a quick, re-usable workflow for publishing over time. Or build custom design elements for your post with an HTML card, and use a snippet to insert it.\nOnce you get a few useful snippets set up, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to go back to the old way of diving through media libraries and trawling for that one thing you know you used somewhere that one time.\n Publishing and newsletters the easy way When you\u0026rsquo;re ready to publish, Ghost makes it as simple as possible to deliver your new post to all your existing members. Just hit the Preview link and you\u0026rsquo;ll get a chance to see what your content looks like on Web, Mobile, Email and Social.\nYou can send yourself a test newsletter to make sure everything looks good in your email client, and then hit the Publish button to decide who to deliver it to.\nGhost comes with a streamlined, optimized email newsletter template that has settings built-in for you to customize the colors and typography. We\u0026rsquo;ve spent countless hours refining the template to make sure it works great across all email clients, and performs well for email deliverability.\nSo, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to fight the awful process of building a custom email template from scratch. It\u0026rsquo;s all done already!\n The Ghost editor is powerful enough to do whatever you want it to do. With a little exploration, you\u0026rsquo;ll be up and running in no time.\n","permalink":"https://leventbekdemir.com/posts/write/","summary":"A full overview of all the features built into the Ghost editor, including powerful workflow automations to speed up your creative process.","title":"Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide"},{"content":"What sets Ghost apart from other products is that you can publish content and grow your audience using the same platform. Rather than just endlessly posting and hoping someone is listening, you can track real signups against your work and have them subscribe to be notified of future posts. The feature that makes all this possible is called Portal.\nPortal is an embedded interface for your audience to sign up to your site. It works on every Ghost site, with every theme, and for any type of publisher.\nYou can customize the design, content and settings of Portal to suit your site, whether you just want people to sign up to your newsletter — or you\u0026rsquo;re running a full premium publication with user sign-ins and private content.\nOnce people sign up to your site, they\u0026rsquo;ll receive an email confirmation with a link to click. The link acts as an automatic sign-in, so subscribers will be automatically signed-in to your site when they click on it. There are a couple of interesting angles to this:\nBecause subscribers are automatically able to sign in and out of your site as registered members: You can (optionally) restrict access to posts and pages depending on whether people are signed-in or not. So if you want to publish some posts for free, but keep some really great stuff for members-only, this can be a great draw to encourage people to sign up!\nGhost members sign in using email authentication links, so there are no passwords for people to set or forget. You can turn any list of email subscribers into a database of registered members who can sign in to your site. Like magic.\nPortal makes all of this possible, and it appears by default as a floating button in the bottom-right corner of your site. When people are logged out, clicking it will open a sign-up/sign-in window. When members are logged in, clicking the Portal button will open the account menu where they can edit their name, email, and subscription settings.\nThe floating Portal button is completely optional. If you prefer, you can add manual links to your content, navigation, or theme to trigger it instead.\nLike this! Sign up here\n As you start to grow your registered audience, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to get a sense of who you\u0026rsquo;re publishing for and where those people are coming from. Best of all: You\u0026rsquo;ll have a straightforward, reliable way to connect with people who enjoy your work.\nSocial networks go in and out of fashion all the time. Email addresses are timeless.\nGrowing your audience is valuable no matter what type of site you run, but if your content is your business, then you might also be interested in setting up premium subscriptions.\n","permalink":"https://leventbekdemir.com/posts/portal/","summary":"How Ghost allows you to turn anonymous readers into an audience of active subscribers, so you know what\u0026rsquo;s working and what isn\u0026rsquo;t.","title":"Building your audience with subscriber signups"},{"content":"As you grow, you\u0026rsquo;ll probably want to start inviting team members and collaborators to your site. Ghost has a number of different user roles for your team:\nContributors\nThis is the base user level in Ghost. Contributors can create and edit their own draft posts, but they are unable to edit drafts of others or publish posts. Contributors are untrusted users with the most basic access to your publication.\nAuthors\nAuthors are the 2nd user level in Ghost. Authors can write, edit and publish their own posts. Authors are trusted users. If you don\u0026rsquo;t trust users to be allowed to publish their own posts, they should be set as Contributors.\nEditors\nEditors are the 3rd user level in Ghost. Editors can do everything that an Author can do, but they can also edit and publish the posts of others - as well as their own. Editors can also invite new Contributors \u0026amp; Authors to the site.\nAdministrators\nThe top user level in Ghost is Administrator. Again, administrators can do everything that Authors and Editors can do, but they can also edit all site settings and data, not just content. Additionally, administrators have full access to invite, manage or remove any other user of the site.\nThe Owner\nThere is only ever one owner of a Ghost site. The owner is a special user which has all the same permissions as an Administrator, but with two exceptions: The Owner can never be deleted. And in some circumstances the owner will have access to additional special settings if applicable. For example: billing details, if using Ghost(Pro).\n Ask all of your users to fill out their user profiles, including bio and social links. These will populate rich structured data for posts and generally create more opportunities for themes to fully populate their design.\n  If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for insights, tips and reference materials to expand your content business, here\u0026rsquo;s 5 top resources to get you started:\n How to create a premium newsletter (+ some case studies)\nLearn how others run successful paid email newsletter products The ultimate guide to membership websites for creators\nTips to help you build, launch and grow your new membership business The Newsletter Guide\nA 201 guide for taking your newsletters to the next level The proven way to find your niche, explained\nFind the overlap and find a monetizable niche that gets noticed Should you launch a referral program?\nStrategies for building a sustainable referral growth machine  ","permalink":"https://leventbekdemir.com/posts/grow/","summary":"A guide to collaborating with other staff users to publish, and some resources to help you with the next steps of growing your business","title":"How to grow your business around an audience"},{"content":"About Me  I\u0026rsquo;m a lone coder in my daily life and a software engineer in my professional life\n Development Skills go, apple, c, cplusplus, git, linux, ubuntu, visualstudio\nLanguage Proficiency English - Professional Working Proficiency\nEducation  Eskisehir Osmangazi University - Electrical and Electronics Engineering (BSc) Middle East Technical University - Electrical and Electronics Engineering (MSc)  ","permalink":"https://leventbekdemir.com/about/","summary":"About Me  I\u0026rsquo;m a lone coder in my daily life and a software engineer in my professional life\n Development Skills go, apple, c, cplusplus, git, linux, ubuntu, visualstudio\nLanguage Proficiency English - Professional Working Proficiency\nEducation  Eskisehir Osmangazi University - Electrical and Electronics Engineering (BSc) Middle East Technical University - Electrical and Electronics Engineering (MSc)  ","title":"About"}]
