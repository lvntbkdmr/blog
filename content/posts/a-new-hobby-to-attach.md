These days I've been working on a DIY built-in bookcase on top of a cabinet for our home office which I share with my wife. 

Of course when you start a DIY project you first need to get a bunch of tools to be able to build stuff. Therefore, I started researching the minimal setup required for this type of job. Watched several youtube videos, read some very detailed blog posts etc.

I realized that the first thing I need to do before buying tools is to draw and plan what I really need to build. Hence, I learned how to draw woodworking projects in Sketchup.

I finally finished my first Sketchup draft that I'll be sharing in here. I will also post the step-by-step guide how I got to the finish line. Stay tuned !
